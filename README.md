In most cases, I implement everything exactly as they are presented
in the book and use the same variable names and steps. There's very
little programming trickery or cleverness.

Input data are in _data/_. They look like CSV files, but I include a
few lines at the top to note their source. Files are tagged with 1990
(Third Edition) or 2010 (Fourth Edition).
